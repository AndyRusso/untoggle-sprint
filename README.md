# Untoggle Sprint
This mod changes the "Sprint: Hold" behavior to "Sprint: Untoggle".

What it does is: instead of sprinting when you hold the sprint key, this makes you walk when you hold it, and sprint when the sprint key is not held.

Make sure you have sprinting set to Untoggle.

No dependencies, no configuration.
